Kubernetes History
* Modeled around a Personal [Borg](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/) Cell

## Kubernetes Resource Types

The North Star Diagram 
* Kubernetes logical components that wrap application code
* Refer back to this diagram if you get lost in all the new Kubernetes terms
* Just remember everything in Kubernetes is performing some function to keep your code running
