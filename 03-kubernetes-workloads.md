# Kubernetes Tutorial - Kubernetes Workloads

All workloads run Pods at their core.

In this section:
* Deployments - Resilient, scalable long running workload with zero downtime upgrades
* Jobs - Running a workload to guaranteed completion
* CronJobs - Running a workload to guaranteed completion on a time schedule
* Stateful Sets - Running a workload with persistent storage
* Daemon Sets - Running a workload on every Linux worker node
<br />

## Kubernetes Workloads

> Problem Statement: 
> I want to have zero downtime when doing software deployments and I want a resilient microservices application

> tl;dr â€“ The thing that controls how you do upgrades with zero-downtime, also resilience with replicas

kubernetes.io bookmark: [Running an example Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#running-an-example-job)

* This example Job manifest computes Ï€ to 2000 places and prints it out:

```yaml
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:

      restartPolicy: Never

EOF
```

```bash
pods=$(kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=pi --output=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
kubectl logs $pods
```

kubernetes.io bookmark: [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#example)

* This example CronJob manifest prints the current time and a hello message every minute:

```yaml

<details class="faq box"><summary>Kubernetes StatefulSet (sts) - Running a workload with persistent storage</summary>
<p>

StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.
* Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

kubernetes.io bookmark: [Creating a StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/)

* This example StatefulSet manifest creates a headless Service, nginx, to publish the IP addresses of Pods in the StatefulSet, web:

```yaml
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx

## Kubernetes Workload Best Practices 

<details class="faq box"><summary>Static Code Analysis - Deployment</summary>
<p>

* [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) - kube-score is a tool that performs static code analysis of your Kubernetes object definitions

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```console
    [WARNING] Deployment has host PodAntiAffinity
      Â· Deployment does not have a host podAntiAffinity set
      It's recommended to set a podAntiAffinity that stops multiple pods from a deployment from being scheduled on the same node. 
      This increases availability in case the node becomes unavailable.
    [CRITICAL] Deployment has PodDisruptionBudget
      Â· No matching PodDisruptionBudget was found
      It's recommended to define a PodDisruptionBudget to avoid unexpected downtime during Kubernetes maintenance operations 
      Such as when draining a node.
```

Notes:
  * tl;dr - Don't put all your eggs in the same basket 
  * podAntiAffinity stops multiple pods from a deployment from being scheduled on the same node
  * This increases availability in case a node becomes unavailable

```console
    [CRITICAL] Deployment has PodDisruptionBudget
      Â· No matching PodDisruptionBudget was found
      It's recommended to define a PodDisruptionBudget to avoid unexpected downtime during Kubernetes maintenance operations

Notes: 
* tl;dr - Please cluster administrators, cool your jets, this is a critical application and I need my application to be available
* A PodDisruptionBudget defines the budget of voluntary disruption during scheduled maintenance 
* If you do not have a PodDisruptionBudget in place your workload might go offline when a cluster maintenance event is in place
* Ensures a certain number or percentage of pods with an assigned label will not Voluntarily be evicted at any one point in time

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
```
