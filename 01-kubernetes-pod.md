# Kubernetes Tutorial - Kubernetes Pod & Friends

 A pod should be considered as the smallest unit of execution in Kubernetes and all Kubernetes workload types run Pods at their core.

In this section:
- Pod - A pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes
- Limits and Requests - CPU and Memory reservation for a Pod
- Liveness and Readiness - Health Checks for a Pod
- ServiceAccount - Functional ID inside the Pod to connect to the API server
- Security Context - Linux privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container

<p>

> tl;dr – Kubernetes always respects the Law of Three

There are three container types:
* [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) #👈👈👈 Part of CKAD exam
  * A container image is a ready-to-run software package, containing everything needed to run an application: 
    * the code and any runtime it requires, application and system libraries, and default values for any essential settings
* [initContainers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) #👈👈👈 Part of CKAD exam
  * Specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod
  * Init containers can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in an app image
* [ephemeralcontainers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/)
  * A special type of container that runs temporarily in an existing Pod to accomplish user-initiated actions such as [troubleshooting](https://github.com/jamesbuckett/ckad-advanced-topics/blob/master/05-kubernetes-pod-ephemeral.md)

<details class="faq box"><summary>Liveness and Readiness Probes - Probe Types</summary>
<p>

> tl;dr – Kubernetes always respects the Law of Three

There are three probe types:
* [livenessProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#types-of-probe) #👈👈👈 Part of CKAD exam
  * Kubernetes uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container 
  * If a container is unresponsive, perhaps the application is deadlocked due to a multi-threading defect, restarting the container can make the application more available, despite the defect
  * For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress
  * The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container
    * If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy  
* [readinessProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#types-of-probe) #👈👈👈 Part of CKAD exam
  * Kubernetes uses readiness probes to decide when the container is available for accepting traffic 
  * The readiness probe is used to control which pods are used as the backends for a service 
  * A pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready 
  * If a pod is not ready, it is removed from service load balancers 
  * For example, if a container loads a large cache at startup and takes minutes to start, you do not want to send requests to this container until it is ready, or the requests will fail—you want to route requests to other pods, which are capable of servicing requests.  
* [startupProbe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#types-of-probe)
  * Indicates whether the application within the container is started 
  * All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided, until it succeeds
  * If the startup probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy

</p>
</details>

<details class="faq box"><summary>Liveness and Readiness Probes - Probe Checks</summary>
<p>

> tl;dr – Kubernetes always respects the Law of Three, sometimes Four

There are three probe checks:
* [exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#probe-check-methods) 
  * Executes a specified command inside the container. 
  * The diagnostic is considered successful if the command exits with a status code of 0.
* [httpGet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#probe-check-methods) #👈👈👈 Part of CKAD exam
  * Performs an HTTP GET request against the Pod's IP address on a specified port and path
  * The diagnostic is considered successful if the response has a status code greater than or equal to 200 and less than 400
* [tcpSocket](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#probe-check-methods)
  * Performs a TCP check against the Pod's IP address on a specified port
  * The diagnostic is considered successful if the port is open 
  * If the remote system (the container) closes the connection immediately after it opens, this counts as healthy

I lied there is one extra probe check:
* [grpc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#probe-check-methods) `alpha feature`
*   Performs a remote procedure call using gRPC
*   The target should implement gRPC health checks
*   The diagnostic is considered successful if the status of the response is SERVING
*   gRPC probes are an alpha feature and are only available if you enable the GRPCContainerProbe feature gate

</p>
</details>

<details class="faq box"><summary>Liveness and Readiness Probes - Probe Results</summary>
<p>

> tl;dr – Kubernetes always respects the Law of Three

There are three probe results:
* Success
  * The container passed the diagnostic
* Failure
  * The container failed the diagnostic
* Unknown
  * The diagnostic failed (no action should be taken, and the kubelet will make further checks)

        · my-pod -> Memory limit is not set

           It's recommended to always set the ImagePullPolicy to Always, to make sure that the imagePullSecrets are always correct, and to always get the image you want.
           
    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be supported by the CNI
            implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster to have an effect.

Notes:

Notes:

* Requiring the use of a read only root file system
* readOnlyRootFilesystem is one setting that controls whether a container is able to write into its filesystem

    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        · Container has the same readiness and liveness probe
            Using the same probe for liveness and readiness is very likely dangerous. 
            Generally it's better to avoid the livenessProbe than re-using the readinessProbe.
            More information: https://github.com/zegl/kube-score/blob/master/README_PROBES.md
```

Please read [Readiness and Liveness Probes](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score/blob/master/README_PROBES.md)

Notes:
* Container has the same readiness and liveness probe
* Using the same probe for liveness and readiness is very likely dangerous
* Generally it's better to avoid the livenessProbe than re-using the readinessProbe
* Set interval (default: 10s), timeout (default: 1s), successThreshold (default: 1), failureThreshold (default: 3) to your needs. 
* In the default configuration, your application will fail for 30s (+ the time it takes for the network to react), for clients to stop sending traffic to your application.

livenessProbe:
* tl;dr: Is the container healthy right now, or do we need to restart it?
* It can be used to let Kubernetes know if your application is deadlocked, and needs to be restarted. 
* Only the container with the failing probe will be restarted, other containers in the same Pod will be unaffected.
* Do not use livenessProbe unless you have a clear use case

readinessProbe:
* tl;dr: Is it a good idea to send traffic to this Pod right now?
* Without a readinessProbe you're risking that:
  * Traffic is sent to the Pod before the server has started.
  * Traffic is still sent to the Pod after the Pod has stopped.
* Use for applications to decide when a pod should receive traffic  

```yaml
    readinessProbe: ## 👈👈👈 Add a properly configured readinessProbe to notify kubelet your Pods are ready for traffic
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10 ## 👈👈👈 Probes start running after initialDelaySeconds after container is started (default: 0 seconds)
      periodSeconds: 20 ## 👈👈👈 How often probe should run (default: 10 seconds)

      successThreshold: 1   ## 👈👈👈 Required number of successful probes to mark container healthy/ready (default: 1 iteration)
